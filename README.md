## Sivan Patel

An enthusiastic and dedicated junior web developer. Having started to code during my time at university, I was eager to delve more into the world of tech and so upon leaving I applied to Makers Academy in order to learn more.

I am looking to start a career in an environment which will help me to continue learning and honing the skills that I have begun to develop.


## Project Examples

|Project Name | Description |

## Skills

#### Love the Struggle
For the last three months, every day has been a struggle. I have learnt to become comfortable in this situation; not knowing what to do has become a regular occurance for me.

Through this, I am constantly learning.

#### Efficient Research

At Makers Academy, lots of emphasis is placed on self-learning. This was a great contrast from my time at university where lots of the work was hand-held. At Makers Academy I have had to improve my research skills in order to learn things for myself. I have found that this has increased my knowledge retention greatly.

An example of this is during lab week; in a team of three we learnt the basics of Swift and made an Instagram clone app: FireFly (as linked above) in three days.

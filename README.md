## Sivan Patel

An enthusiastic and dedicated junior web developer. Having started to code during my time at university, I was eager to delve more into the world of tech and so upon leaving I applied to Makers Academy in order to learn more.

I am looking to start a career in an environment which will help me to continue learning and honing the skills that I have begun to develop.


## Project Examples

|Project Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| <a href="https://github.com/ShuflCast/randCast">rand(Cast)</a>  | Final project submission for Makers Academy. A mobile Ionic app that finds new podcasts based on the users genre and time frame requirements. |
| <a href="https://github.com/sivanpatel/onTap_2">onTap</a> | A web app built with AngularJS to find pubs that are local to you, built in 2 days during a hackathon. The Yelp and Google Maps APIs were used to find pubs and display them on a map. |
|<a href="https://github.com/katylouise/FireFlyApp">FireFly</a> | An Instagram clone made using Swift in 3 days, during lab week|

## Skills

#### Love the Struggle
For the last three months, every day has been a struggle. I have learnt to become comfortable in this situation; not knowing what to do has become a regular occurance for me. Failure has become my first step to success. Often I will find myself stuck with a problem but through struggling, failing, and asking the right questions, I will succeed.

Through this, I am learning how to become a developer.

#### Efficient Research

At Makers Academy, lots of emphasis is placed on self-learning. This was a great contrast from my time at university where lots of the work was hand-held. At Makers Academy I have had to improve my research skills in order to learn things for myself. I have found that this has increased my knowledge retention greatly.

An example of this is during lab week; in a team of three we learnt the basics of Swift and made an Instagram clone app - FireFly (as linked above) - in three days.
